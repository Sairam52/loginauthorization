    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>Short for cascading style sheets, CSS is a language used to describe reusable styles for presenting documents
      written in a markup language. Its concept was originated by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994. In December 1996, CSS was made
      a
      specification by the W3C and today allows web developers to alter the layout and appearance of their web pages.
      For
      example, CSS may be used to change the font used in certain HTML element, and its size and color. A single CSS
      file
      may be linked to multiple pages, which allows a developer to change the appearance of all the pages at the same
      time.</p>
    <p>The following contains a basic example of using CSS code to define fonts, the color of hyperlinks, and the color
      of
      a link when the mouse cursor hovers over. In this specific example, we are only changing the HTML tags &lt;a&gt;
      and
      &lt;body&gt;, rather than creating any new class or id selectors.</p>
    <p>body {<br>
      font: normal 100% "trebuchet ms", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
      }<br>
      a {<br>
      color: #000000;<br>
      }<br>
      a:visited {<br>
      color: #005177;<br>
      }<br>
      a:hover {<br>
      color: #005177;<br>
      }</p>
    <h2>CSS3</h2>
    <p>CSS3 is the version of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that replaces CSS2. It introduces new selectors and
      properties
      that allow for more flexibility with page layout and presentation. Some updates, such as the box-shadow property
      (which allows an element drop shadow), allow visual effects to be applied without the need for creating special
      images.</p>
