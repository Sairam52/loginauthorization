    <h1>HTML </h1>
    <p>First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create
      electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of
      connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version
      of
      HTML code or another.

      HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser
      would
      not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of
      the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the
      bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).
    </p>
    <p>Below is an example of a basic web page written in HTML with a description of each section and its function.</p>
    <p>
      &lt;html&gt;<br>
      &lt;head&gt;<br>
      &lt;title&gt;Example page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
      &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"&gt;<br>
      &lt;head&gt;<br>
      &lt;body&gt;<br>
      &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
      &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;b&gt;example&lt;/b&gt; of a basic HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
      &lt;/body&gt;<br>
      &lt;/html&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
      &lt;/body&gt;<br>
      &lt;/html&gt;<br>
    <p> Each of the lines are explained below in further detail.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The DOCTYPE line describes what version of HTML the page was written in so that an Internet browser can
        interpret the text that follows.</li>
      <li>The &lt;html&gt; opening tag lets the browser know that it is reading HTML code.</li>
      <li>The &lt;head&gt; section contains information about the page, such as its title, meta tags, and where to
        locate
        the CSS file.</li>
      <li>The &lt;body&gt;section contains everything that's viewable on the browser. For example, all the text seen
        here
        is contained in the body tags.</li>
      <li>The &lt;h1&gt; tag is the visible heading of the page.</li>
      <li>The &lt;p&gt; tag is a paragraph of text. Most web pages (like this one) have several paragraph tags.</li>
      <li>Contained in the paragraph is the &lt;b&gt; tag that bolds the word example in the paragraph.</li>
      <li>Finally, the closing tags wrap each of the above tags.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</body>
